# DAO Mall for Pi Encryption

This document provides an overview of the encryption techniques used in the DAO Mall for Pi project.

## Encryption Techniques

- **Symmetric Encryption:** Symmetric encryption is used to encrypt user data stored on the server. A secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Asymmetric encryption is used to secure transactions on the Pi blockchain. A public key is used to encrypt the transaction, and a private key is used to decrypt it.

## Key Management

- **Key Generation:** Keys are generated using a secure random number generator.
- **Key Storage:** Keys are stored securely using encryption and access controls.
- **Key Rotation:** Keys are regularly rotated to ensure their security.

## Data Protection

- **Data-at-Rest Encryption:** Data stored on the server is encrypted using symmetric encryption.
- **Data-in-Transit Encryption:** Data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
